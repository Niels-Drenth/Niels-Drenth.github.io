					<h2>Founder of Toia</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">January 2016 - December 2018</p>
					<p>My first business specialized in Italian food and drinks. My idea was to create a link between the Italian cuisine and the demand for new food trends in my country, making my customers experience good food and good drinks out of the casual channels like Italian restaurants or Italian food stores.
During the start of this business I started to develop myself more and more into a marketer, I put into practice what i had learned in university and while working I got more and more into this subject and still I am eager to learn the latest marketing techniques, especially SEO. Thanks to this business experience, I got to improve and develop my organisational skills through work and staff planning as well as my communication competence, being the spokesperson for the company.</p>

					<p class="subDetails">October 2014 - April 2016</p>
					<p>During my studies I decided to focus on, and learn everything about the Italian kitchen. And where better to learn than in the house of Leonardo Da Vinci’s own grandmother in Tuscany, Italy. As a matter of fact I did quite succesfully but I also dealt with organizing a kitchen, planning, buying and storing food and supplies in a small but very well organized reality.</p>

Tolerance, patience but also dedication, perseverance and determination are the qualities I had to put into practice to succeed in such a challenging but also rewarding chance. This kind of job calls for Team-working and communication abbilities which I had the chance to improve and enhance.</p>
